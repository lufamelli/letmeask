## About the project

Letmeask was created with Next.js, during the
sixth edition of NLW (Next Level Week), an event organized by Rockteseat (https://rocketseat.com.br/ "Rocketseat website").

The application gives us the functionality of create rooms, wich will be open to host questions of the participants, you can log in with a google account.
The questions can be liked by the common participants and can be marked as important, as answered or even be deleted by the room administrator. 
You can change to admin view by adding /admin/ in the link of the room, before "rooms" and after "app", as you can see in the images above.
This NLW edition was a very fun challenge. I had the oppotunity to use Realtime db, Authentication and hosting from firebase, and also enrich my React knowledge 
using State, use Effect, Refs, Contexts and others, created useAuth and useroom hooks, create pages based on single-page application(SPA), used CSS Sass, 
used React Router DOM.
